    <p1>From downtown Chicago, to south Minneapolis, I have navigated my career path from salesperson to soux chef. It is now I embark on my greatest journey of all: full stack development. It is here my culmination of knowledge will come to roost in creativity. My goal is to create unique websites that stand out for you, the customer, that are easy to read and engaging. Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
    
    <p1> My hobbies include disc golf and running, all else pail in comparison, honestly. I'm married and have a wonderful family full of nearly every creature under the sun-including a dog, cat, and two rats whom I love dearly. I love summers and despise winters. I like crepes more than pancakes. Chicken and waffles are amazing too, though. Thanks for your time.</p>
